**Why is this useful?**

Due to the recent revamp of floor 7, players are not fully used to the new mechanics they may encounter. As such, this mod will help you get a better understanding of what is going on by giving various alerts concerning boss abilities, phases and other indicators. It also has solvers for all of the new terminals constantly updated.

**Is this bannable?**
This mod is completely allowed as it only renders the boss room you are presently occupying.
